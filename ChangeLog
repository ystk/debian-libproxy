	* === Released 0.3.1 ===
	- Bugfixes
	  + config file parser reads all sections
	  + KDE session detection based on environment varibales,
	    as suggested by KDE upstream.
	- KDE configuration module is the first module in C++ and
	  now links to libkdecore4 in order to properly detect the
	  configuration folder for kde.
	- At the moment we're not compatible with KDE3. Sorry.
	- .NET bindings can now properly be installed and it should
	  be possible for packagers to provide them.
