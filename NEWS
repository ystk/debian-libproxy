====================
- Bugfixes
  + config file parser reads all sections
  + KDE session detection based on environment varibales,
    as suggested by KDE upstream.
- KDE configuration module is the first module in C++ and
  now links to libkdecore4 in order to properly detect the
  configuration folder for kde.
- At the moment we're not compatible with KDE3. Sorry.
- .NET bindings can now properly be installed and it should
  be possible for packagers to provide them.
