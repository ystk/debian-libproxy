===== Overview =====
Each test for libproxy should be self-contained and simple
enough to only test one function at a time. You've been given
the flexibility to write test in any language you choose but
must follow a certain format for things to work properly.

===== Format =====
Each test is required to output "pass" and "reason" lines
in bourne shell variable format. The testsuite will exec
each test to load the variables and then output the results.

"pass" should return true or false and "name" is optional.

pass=[true | false]
reason="Reason why this test failed"
name="example_test_name"

===== Issues =====
- Very limited test coverage. This needs to be fully fleshed out.
- libproxy_test_envvar.test runs sucessfully on Ubuntu 8.10, but fails on
  Ubuntu 8.04.1 and Fedora 9
